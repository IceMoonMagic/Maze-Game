# Maze Game
A simple maze game in to learn Godot.

## Top Down Maze
A simple 2D Maze. The appearance can basically be completely customized, from changing the colors to the thicknesses of lines.

As the player moves, there it leaves two lines behind it.
1. To show everywhere explored
2. To show the direct path from the start to current position.

When finishing a maze, the only thing that happens is you can't move anymore, that'll probably change eventually.

## First Person Maze
To Do

Same generation as the top down. But exploring in first person.
Plan:
- Use normal movement instead of auto to next junction
- Goal to look like a snowy / winter hedge maze
- indicate paths
    + just "drag a string" and / or breadcrumbs
    + different colors on lanterns or similar
- start / end is a lift or portal to a room
- general appearance likely less customizable
